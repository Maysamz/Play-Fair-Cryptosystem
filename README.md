  <h1>Playfair Cipher Java Implementation</h1>
  <p>The Playfair cipher is a classical symmetric encryption technique that operates on pairs of letters, or digraphs, providing an additional layer of security. It was invented in 1854 and gained popularity during World War I and II .</p>

  <p>This project aims to implement the Playfair cipher algorithm using Java. The goal is to create a user-friendly program with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows easy message encryption and decryption.</p>

  <p>The algorithm involves generating a 5x5 grid of letters based on a chosen keyword, which serves as the key for encryption and decryption. Pairs of letters in the plaintext are replaced with corresponding pairs from the Playfair grid .</p>

  <p>By implementing the Playfair cipher in Java, this project provides a practical learning experience for symmetric encryption techniques and cryptographic algorithms. The program offers an interactive and visually appealing demonstration of the encryption and decryption processes.</p>
